The Loan Default Prediction Project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether a customer is likely to default on a loan. Using Python, the project begins with data preprocessing to clean and prepare the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to uncover insights and relationships between features like income, credit history, and loan amount. Models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost are trained and evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. The final model predicts loan defaults, enabling financial institutions to mitigate risks effectively.
